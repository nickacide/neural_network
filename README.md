# A Rust-based Neural Network

This is my attempt at creating a traditional neural network. I am brand new to the calc behind backpropagation which is why that's not implemented yet. 

My implementation focuses on creating a neural network with custom parameters. It's much easier to create a fixed-size neural network and do the backprop math by hand, but I want to accomodate any size. The backprop math has to be dynamic and fit any size parameters, which is quite hard to implement (for me at least).

If you are knowledgeable about the math behind backpropagation and how it works then **please** let me know. Your help will be thoroughly appreciated.
